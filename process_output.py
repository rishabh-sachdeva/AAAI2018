"""
This file averages results together from muliple runs of a file. There
are several possible ways this can happen.
1. The runs are stored in different files with the same name
2. The runs are all stored in the same file
Either way, this takes the start of the output file name, and will average
the results with that name + _averaged.csv as the output file.
